/**
 * Group encryption, by sender keys.

 * Groups had none at all — the send path excluded them outright, so every
 * group message arrived at the server readable.
 *
 * Pairwise X3DH does not fit a group: encrypting each message once per member
 * means N ciphertexts on the wire and N ratchets to keep in step, and it gets
 * worse with every member. Instead each member holds one symmetric key for
 * the group, encrypts each message once with it, and seals that key to each
 * other member over the pairwise session that already exists. The server
 * moves sealed blobs it cannot open.
 *
 * The cost, stated plainly: a sender key does not ratchet forward like the
 * pairwise session does, so someone who obtains it can read everything sent
 * under it until the next rotation. Membership changes force a rotation,
 * which is what makes leaving a group mean anything.
