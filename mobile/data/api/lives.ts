/**
 * Live broadcasts.
 *
 * A live is not a call. In a call everyone publishes to everyone; in a
 * broadcast one person publishes to an audience that cannot publish back. The
 * difference is enforced in the token the SFU checks — a viewer's token
 * carries `CanPublish: false`, so an audience member cannot appear in someone
 * else's broadcast by patching the app.
 *
 * Not end-to-end encrypted, and deliberately so. A call derives its media key
 * from the session between two people; an audience of strangers has no such
 * session, and inventing a key the server hands out would be encryption in
 * name only. The streams are encrypted to the SFU and the SFU can read them.
 * The screen says so — the app promises E2EE everywhere else and a quiet
 * exception would be a lie.
